# Policy-Management_SpringBoot

##About the Project
The Spring Boot project is a web application designed to manage clients, insurance policies, and claims. The project has three model classes, namely Client, InsurancePolicy, and Claim.  
  
The Client model class is used to store information about the clients who have purchased insurance policies. This includes attributes such as the client's name, address, email, and phone number. Each client can have one or more insurance policies associated with them.  
  
The InsurancePolicy model class is used to store information about the insurance policies purchased by the clients. This includes attributes such as the policy number, start date, end date, coverage amount, and premium. Each policy is associated with one client.  
  
The Claim model class is used to store information about the claims made by the clients against their insurance policies. This includes attributes such as the claim number, claim date, claim amount, and claim status. Each claim is associated with one policy.
